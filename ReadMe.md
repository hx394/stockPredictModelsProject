Contributors: Hongzhen Xu, Cheyi Wu, Jingming Cheng

Project Overview: 
Using GRU, LSTM, GRU-Garch Hybrid, LSTM-Garch Hybrid, LSTM-Arima Hybrid models to predict stock price.
Applying plots and statistics among compare groups to evaluate the various approaches and models.

Instructions for GRU and LSTM models(accomplished by Hongzhen Xu):

When run the code, make sure the paths to the files are correct.

The GRU rate model and LSTM rate model were trained on Google Colab, 
but the models were not saved because of the capacity.

If you would like to run the deep learning code in an environment other than Google Colab, 
you need to change the code a little bit to read input files and write output files. 
Make sure you have Python 3.8+, the following dependencies are required:

torch
torchvision
torch.nn
torch.optim 
numpy
pandas
sklearn.preprocessing
sklearn.model_selection
torch.utils.data
matplotlib.pyplot
tqdm
